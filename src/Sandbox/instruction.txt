In each stage your goal is to destroy all balls                 .

The balls have different sizes. After being hit the ball splits into smaller ones.

By clicking spacebar you can shoot a bomb in the direction indicated

 by the green arrow.

You can rotate the arrow by pressing left arrow or right arrow on the keyboard.

Finally, you can move the player            sideways by pressing A and D.

Be careful, if the player            is hit by the ball            , the stage ends.

Good luck.
